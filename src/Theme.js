                    With all of us waking up every day to a monotonous regime, a break is everything we need. In the midst of the chaos, we need to escape from dreariness and write our own books with chapters of memories to be cherished forever. Thus, here we are with the theme of Pyrokinesis, 2022- Bohemian Escapade. The pandemic was unveiling, a dark cloud threatened with revere ready to burst a fantasy deterring on the verge of shear exuberance and absolute fanaticism, vibing to unleashed energy and fun celebrating across the barrier of reality and ennui. The phrase “Bohemian Escapade” lays stress on escaping the monotony of life in unconventional artistic ways, in four nights with a million emotions. The rousing days and the ecstatic nights, with bass dropping low and gleaming toes, providing the showdown to a festival of such magnitude letting each one to drown in the waves of majestic music. The loud music silence the crowd’s cheer, a line of famous personalities presents their incarcerating pieces and greet a joyous horde at its full roar. Henceforth, the electrifying nights leave imprints of togetherness and merriment in the lives of people.
